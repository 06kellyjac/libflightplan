# libsubcli (Zig and C)

libsubcli is a library for building command-line interfaces (CLIs) with
subcommands in the same style as `git` and other populate modern CLIs.
The library is available as a native Zig library as well as a standard
C library (both in static and shared library form). Anything that can
interface with C and interface with this library.
